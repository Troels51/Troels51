### Troels Dalsgaard Hoffmeyer
## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently playing with:
- Rust, in all of its facets
- https://bevyengine.org/, dipping my toes into game programming
- Testing out async code with Tokio and Serde, while implementing a Jet client (https://github.com/Troels51/rjet)
- Had fun in Advent of code (https://github.com/Troels51/adventofcode2021)
- Did a connect4 solver (https://github.com/Troels51/connect4)
